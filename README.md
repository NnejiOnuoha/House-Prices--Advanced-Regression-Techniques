# House-Prices--Advanced-Regression-Techniques
This project is a data science competition hosted on Kaggle.

The competition focuses on predicting the final price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, based on a dataset with 79 explanatory variables.

I utilized creative feature engineering and advanced regression techniques such as random forest and gradient boosting to improve the accuracy of my predictions.

The aim of this project was to expand my skill set in machine learning and data science. Overall, this project offered me an opportunity to apply my knowledge and gain practical experience in predictive modeling.
